# large_cast_rpg
Work-in-progress for a table-top role-playing game featuring politics, manipulation, warfare, and hand-to-hand combat.

## 3.xx Carrying Capacity

Characters of endurance 2 have a 6x8 grid. Each object takes up space on
the grid, and if an object cannot fit into the grid, then it cannot be
carried by the character. Small objects do not take space on the grid,
but a character can only carry 8 before they count as normal sized
objects. Weapons count against the grid whether they are in the hands,
on a belt, or in a pack somewhere. Worn armour and clothing doesn't
count against the grid.

For each value of endurance above or below 2, a character gains or loses
2 spaces on their grid. Spaces are added in rows to the long side, and
removed in rows from the short side.
