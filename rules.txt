:  1.01.01 : The Stories of [Insert Name of RPG]

A common feature of fantasy stories, especially the sorts of fantasy
stories found in long books and series, is that they follow many
characters through many plots. In a book about a fantasy war, one
character might be at the king's court and is involved in the decision
making, another might be with the army taking part in the day-to-day
campaigning, and a third might be captured by the enemy, learn some
important new information, and need to escape and make their way back to
their homeland with that information.

The [Insert Name of RPG] is meant to play out these sorts of stories.
Instead of the more traditional "party" based structure that most
tabletop role-playing games use, the players in this game each control
3-5 main characters. This results in a cast of main characters. These
characters will be rulers of their town, region, or nation, engage with
political discussions and decision-making, lead their people into
battle, fight their enemies, and go on adventures. Together, their
actions will define the fate of the region.

::::::::::::
:  1.01.02 : The Settings of [Insert Name of RPG]

There is not a single defined setting for this game. However, the
equipment, characters, and capabilities give implied parameters on the
setting. This game was designed for fantasy settings where there is
little to no magic, the populace is mostly poor, rural, and uneducated,
the politics are fragmented and shifting, and the technology is pre-
gunpowder but will into city-building. In short, most settings that are
similar to real-world culture from 500 BC to 1500 AD would be good
inspiration for the types of settings that will work with this game.

::::::::::::
:  1.01.03 : The Players of [Insert Name of RPG]

All players in [Insert Name of RPG] will take on the control of many
characters. They will also need to be proactive: coming up with goals
and taking action to achieve that goal. Additionally, the mechanics can
fairly easily end up in characters being influenced into poor decisions,
in characters failing to succeed at their goals, or characters being
gravely injured or killed.

For this reason, the type of players who are most likely to enjoy this
game are players who are proactive, can handle meta-information without
it affecting their characters' actions too much, and who are willing to
carry out actions for their characters that they (the player) think is a
poor course of action.

::::::::::::
:  1.01.04 : The Mechanics of [Insert Name of RPG]

The mechanics revolve around four subsystems: Discussions, Contested
Movement, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Mass Combat. Much of the game will
consist of individual scenes strung together. Each scene will be played
out through one of these subsystems and will involved different
characters and locations as dictated by the events in the game. For
scenes that don't fall under one of the subsystems, the game will fall
back on more free form role-play aided by a skill check mechanic.

The subsystems are designed to flow into each other. For example,
suppose Lady Ella Avitch wants to lead a raid against a town ruled by
neighbouring lord. This could play out as a string of scenes:

First, the decision to carry out the raid, and potentially the decisions
around the type of raid, the time, etc. could be a Discussion scene as
Lady Ella consults her advisors and key warriors.

Then, they would gather their raiding party and set off to the town
using a Contested Movement scene, which would also provide the
opportunity for the townsfolk to become aware of the raid and move into
position.

Once the raiding party comes face to face with the defenders, a Mass
Combat scene could be used to resolve that interaction.

Within this battle, Lady Ella might meet the neighbouring lord's master
at arms in single combat with a Hand-to-Hand scene.

Finally, depending on how this all plays out, one side of the other
might seek out a parley with a Discussion scene.

++++++++++++
+  1.02    + General Mechanics

Many situations can be resolved with one of the 4 subsystems. Within
those subsystems, skill checks are used to resolve opposed actions. For
any other situations where two characters are opposing each other, or an
unopposed character is taking an action with a risk of failure or
consequences, the same skill checks are used. Whenever this more free-
form roleplaying occurs, it should be adjudicated by the table as a
whole. If there are any players whose characters are not involved, they
are considered third-party and can take on extra adjudication
responsibilities.

::::::::::::
:  1.02.01 : Skill Checks

Skill checks are primarily used when two characters are taking actions
that are in opposition to each other. This can include one character
trying to take an action while the other tries to prevent them from
succeed, or both characters trying to take independent actions where it
is important to know which action is quicker or more effective. For this
reason, the vast majority of skill checks use a skill rating from each
of the two characters involved.

When there is only one character taking action, but that action has a
risk of failing or causing other undesired consequences, the skill check
uses a skill rating from the character and substitutes a difficulty
rating for the missing character. The difficulty rating is determined by
third-party players at the table. A good default value is 3. The
consequence of failure should be known to the player before attempting
the unopposed skill check. If they do not want to take the risk
associated with the skill check, they can role-play to change the
situation, which changes the difficulty and consequences.

In the resolution of a skill check, the difference between the skill
ratings (or the skill rating and the difficulty) is used to determine
how many dice to roll. If "d" is the difference (must be positive), then
"d+2" 8-sided dice are rolled. If any single dice shows a 7 or an 8,
then the character with the higher skill rating was successful (or
performed better). If "d" is 0, then a single dice is rolled, with the
characters having an equal chance of success.

::::::::::::
:  1.02.02 : Skill Check Examples

If Morten Avitch is racing against his sister Ella Avitch, then they
might roll their "Run" skills against each other. If Morten's "Run" is 2
and Ella's is 4, then four 8-sided dice are rolled. If any of the dice
show 7 or 8, then Ella is faster. Ella's player rolls the dice, and gets
2, 2, 3, 6, so Morten wins the race.

If Morten Avitch is trying to climb a cliff. He has a "Jump/Climb"
rating of 3, and the cliff has a difficulty of 3 (where the consequence
is falling up to 15 feet, causing a major wound). He doesn't want to
take this risk, so he decides to throw a rope around a tree. (Throwing
the rope doesn't require a roll unless there is a potential consequence,
like a time-pressure or the potential to lost the rope). With the rope
tied, the skill check now has a difficulty of 2, but the consequence is
that Morten is simply too weak to be able to make the climb. Morten can
now roll 3 8-sided dice, where a 7 or 8 indicates a successful climb (as
Morten's "Jump/Climb" is higher than the cliff's difficulty of 2). He
rolls a 4, 6, 8, and makes the climb.

::::::::::::
:  1.02.03 : Note About Dice

In order to play this game, the table as a whole will need at least one
set of commonly-available polyhedral dice. The set consists of a 4-sided
dice, a 6-sided dice, an 8-sided dice, a 10-sided dice (numbered from 0
to 9), a 10-sided dice (numbered from 00 to 90), a 12-sided dice, and a
20-sided dice. It is recommended that the table as a whole has at least
ten 8-sided dice to share.

Technically, the 8-sided dice can be substituted for other dice. The key
property is that they must be a multiple of 4-sided: 4-sided, 8-sided,
12-sided, or 20-sided. For 4-sided dice, success occurs on a 4. For
8-sided dice, success occurs on a 7 or 8. For 12-sided dice, success
occurs on a 10, 11, or 12. Finally, for 20-sided dice, success occurs on
a 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.

++++++++++++
+  1.03    + Skills

Each character has ratings in the following skills:

-   Control: represents coordination, precision, and leverage with
    respect to body movements in Hand-to-Hand combat
-   Fighting Mind: represents experience and cunning in Hand-to-Hand
    combat
-   Speed: represents quickness of motion in Hand-to-Hand combat
-   Strength: represents strength and power in Hand-to-Hand combat

-   Shoot/Aim: covers all sorts of ranged combat where the human body
    is responsible for power and aim, i.e. bows, javelins, spears, and
    slings, but not trebuchets
-   Endurance: the ability to carry out a physical task over an extended
    period of time
-   Hide: the ability to stay still, move without making noise, and
    position the body so as to be unseen and unheard
-   Jump/Climb: self-explanatory

    purposes, such as horses, elephants, or any others. In a pinch, this
    can be used for other types of human-animal interactions
-   Run: self-explanatory
-   Swim: self-explanatory

-   Craft: the ability create or repair human built products, and to use
    the tools associated with those purposes
-   Trade: the ability to make good purchases and sales, to assess the
    value of items, and deal with financial transactions
-   Heal: the ability to treat wounds and cure diseases

The ratings go from 0 to 10, with an average of 2. Most people fall
between 0 and 4.

:::::::::::
: 1.03.01 : Skill Rating Generation

When generating skill ratings for main charactors, the skills are
grouped so that similar skills are rated somewhat similarly:

Hand-to-Hand:       Physical:       Knowledge:      Social:
Control             Endurance       Craft           Administer
Fighting Mind       Hide            Heal            Convince
Speed               Jump/Climb      Know            Lead
Strength            Ride            Notice          Perform
                    Run             Sail            Tactics
                    Shoot/Aim       Survive
                    Swim            Trade

The following process should be used to generate values:

1.  A rating (call it "r") is randomly generated for each of the 4 skill
    rating groups. Each rating is generated by rolling four 4-sided
    dice, summing the lowest 3 values, and subtracting 3.
2.  That rating is multiplied by the number of skills in the group. This
    number is the "bank" that will be split to the skills in the group.
3.  Each skill is assigned a minimum of "r-3", if "r-3" is greater than
    0. For each value assigned to a rating, that same value is removed
    from the "bank".
4.  The remaining values in the "bank" are assigned to the skills
    randomly. If there are "n" skills in the group, then a dice (or
    other random generator) with "n" equal outcomes is used to determine
    which skill receives each value in the bank until the bank is empty.
    (No skill rating can exceed 10).

For example, when generating skill ratings the "Hand-to-Hand" group,
four 4-sided dice are rolled: 4, 2, 2, 3. This results in a value of 4,
as (2+2+3)-3 = 4. Multiplied by the 4 skills in the group gives a bank
of 16. Each of the skills in the group are assigned a minimum of "r-3",
in this case 1: 

Control         1
Fighting Mind   1
Speed           1
Strength        1

The bank is now at 12. A d4 (because the group has 4 skills) is rolled
12 times, resulting in 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1, 4, 4, 3, 4, 1. Each result
of 1 corresponds to the first skill in the group, Control. Therefore,
the final value for Control is 4. The other skill ratings are calculated
in the same way:

Control         1 + 3 = 4
Fighting Mind   1 + 2 = 3
Speed           1 + 2 = 3
Strength        1 + 5 = 6

For non-main characters or just for worldbuilding in general, a slightly
different method should be used. Instead of the dice method described in
step 1 above, a unique distribution should be used. That distribution,
and the distribution that results from  the dice method, are shown
below:
                    Number Per Million
Rating  Non-Main Characters     Main Characters
   0            62500                50800
   1           250000               117200
   2           375000               179700
   3           250000               199200
   4            52000               179700
   5             8700               132800
   6             1500                82000
   7              250                39100
   8               42                15600
   9                7                 3900
  10                1                    0

The actual details of how to produce a rating matching that distribution
are not described here. Any spreadsheet program can do this fairly
easily.

The value of knowing this distribution is that it aids in worldbuilding.
For example, if an army has 2,000 soldiers,
(2,000) * (250+42+7+1)/1,000,000 = 0.6
of them will have a rating 7 or higher. In other words, an army that
size might have one person who is that skilled. Such a rating should be
reserved for the absolute elite of the elite. In a similar way, if a
nation with a population of 3,000,000 puts in significant effort to find
and train everybody between the age of 15 to 25 (about 15% of the
population, or 450,000 people) with a skill of 7 or higher in the
Hand-to-Hand group, they will find 135 people. (Of course, such a
logistical undertaking would be enormous - it would be an accomplishment
to even find 10 of these people).

++++++++++++
+  1.05    + The Structure of a Campaign

[include a note about whether there is a GM: is there?]

::::::::::::
:  1.05.01 : Worldbuilding

At the beginning of a campaign the players will need a setting, and
therefore will need to do some worldbuilding or at minimum do some
research into a setting. Whether the worldbuilding is done by one player
or by all players together, it is strongly advised that all players have
a decent sense of the history, culture, and geography of the setting.
This knowledge will make the creation of characters (in the next
section) much easier.

There is quite a range of settings that will work well with this game
but there are also boundaries that, if crossed, will either cause
problems or will not be supported by the rules.

Magic: There are no rules in the game to support characters (whether
main characters or otherwise) doing magic. Therefore, it is by far
easiest if the setting reflects this, and features minimal magic. If
magic is desired, the easiest way to include it would be through the
characters coming across magical objects, locations, or effects. The
characters can then interact with magic and try to find good ways to
make use of it. While this will take some homebrew work in terms of
determining the magical effects, handling magic this way will keep magic
fairly contained without requiring extensive rules.

Society: It is assumed that most people in the setting are farmers
scratching out a living, as was the case for much of Earth's history. At
least 90% of the people in a given region live in a rural setting. The
few people who are rich or who have unusual talents tend to be the ones
who end up ruling, adventuring, and being main characters.

Politics: A large part of the game involves main characters exerting
influence on each other through their words. Therefore, a setting with
simple politics or a lack of opportunity for disagreements, differences
of opinions or methods, or with all power flowing through a monolithic
organization is not likely to be a good setting. Some political
situations that are ripe for conflict and drama include feudal systems,
city-states with a common culture and high amount of interaction, and
empires whose regions maintain a strong sense of independence.

Technology: The rules of the game assume a certain technological range:
-   Travel on land is done by walking or through the aid of beasts of
    burden,
-   Travel on sea is done by row or sail powered ships,
-   Communication is no faster than messengers travelling as above,
-   Tools are hand-made from wood, stone, and metals such as bronze,
    iron, and early forms of steel,
-   Writing is known but restricted to hand-written forms, limiting
    books and reading to those who are wealthy or trained,
-   Medical science is very limited.
Technologies that may not be compatible with the rules of the game
include firearms & gunpowder, electricity, steam power, and
industrialized machinery.

::::::::::::
:  1.05.02 : Characters

Once a setting has been established, the players will need to create
the main characters. Each player will control 3-5 characters, depending
on their ability to keep track of multiple characters and their
motivations. In addition to controlling their main characters, one
player will control any additional character as needed for a given
scene.

Once the number of main characters is determined, the skill ratings for
the characters are randomly generated using the process described in
section 1.03.01. Motivations are randomly generated using the process
described in section 2.03.03. These two sets of ratings form the bulk of
each main characters numerical description. Other information associated
with main characters will tend to be qualitative: descriptions, names,
relationships, goals, etc.

With the list of character ratings created, the players will go through
a selection and character creation process. Randomly determine an order
for the players (rolling a 20-sided die, with re-rolls to break any
ties, is a good method). In that order, the players each select one of
sets of ratings. They add to the character a name, a context, where the
character lives, other characters that they have relationships with, an
occupation or place in society, an outline of a backstory, etc. This
information can be created on the spot, drawn from the worldbuilding
done previously, or drawn from other characters that have been created.
They should also have some goals in mind for the character, though the
goals do not have to be shared with the group. All this information
should be added to the skill and motivation ratings and written down on
the character sheet.

This selection process is repeated but with the order reversing each
round until all characters have been created.

If a character dies, the best way to handle it is to "upgrade" another
character within the story to the status of main character. If that
character already has skill and motivation ratings, they are maintained.
If they do not, then ratings can be generated as described in sections
1.03.01 and 2.03.03.

::::::::::::
:  1.05.03 : Calendars & Timekeeping

In order to handle all the characters and their actions, the players
should collectively keep a calendar. At the end of scenes that take less
than a day, the most likely next scene for the involved characters
should be marked on the calendar. Then the calendar can used to
determine which scene should be played next. For scenes that take longer
than a day (in particular long-distance Contested Movement), the players
may need to pause the scene to jump over to another scene.

Events and circumstances that are not scenes should also be marked on
the calendar. For example, if a character orders a large number of ships
to be built, the completion date should be marked. If a character is
healing from wounds, the date of each of their successful healing rolls
(see section 00.00.00) should be marked. If a character begins a journey
that is not Contested Movement, their expected arrival date should be
marked.

Whenever the group is uncertain how much time a given activity should
take, they should discuss to arrive at a logical amount of time.

::::::::::::
:  1.05.04 : Economics 

This is not primarily a game about economics, but a game about politics,
leadership, and regional interaction, will inevitably involve economic
matters at some point. To handle this, each political unit and/or
character gets a wealth rating (it is assumed that in the setting,
individual wealther and political power are very tightly related, and
that the wealth of a political unit is largely under the control of the
ruler of that unit). As far as the subsystems go, the most immediate
effect of this wealth rating is in the size and quality of the
character's army, if they have one. Wealth ratings can be changed
through the 4 subsystems. A good rule of thumb is that a wealth rating
can be changed one level for at the conclusion of three successful
scenes played out through the subsystems. Additionally, the wealth
rating can change by a maximum of one level each year. The consequences
of changing wealth levels should be put into place on a yearly basis.
This is easiest to do if there is a season where less scenes occur (such
as winter, or a monsoon season).

The wealth ratings are 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.75, 4.75, 6, 7.5, 9.5,
and 11.5. The wealth rating for each political unit should be determined
during worldbuilding. Once this is done, the exact amount of goods, men,
cities, and ships that the wealth rating can support is reverse-
engineered to match the worldbuilding.

::::::::::::
:  1.05.05 : External Events

Should the campaign need some shaking up (due to inaction on the part of
the players), an external event can be used. These events are external
to the main characters, not necessarily the political unit of the main
characters. They are meant to represent the world around the main
characters changing in a way that forces the main characters to take
action or provides them with opportunities to take advantage of. When an
external event is needed roll two 10-sided dice, using one as the first
digit and the other as the second digit to obtain a number from 0 to 99,
and consult the table below.

 0 -  5  Two neighbouring political units go to war against each other.
 6 - 11  A neighbour political unit begins a war against a main
         character's political unit.
12 - 17  A neighbouring country offers to join in alliance with a main
         character's political unit.
18 - 23  A neighbouring country seeks out a trade deal with a main
         character's political unit.
24 - 29  A plague strikes (with a random chance - about 5% - of killing
         each main character and other important characters).
30 - 36  A natural disaster, such as a storm, fire, earthquake, or
         volcano occurs.
37 - 43  There is a crop failure.
44 - 50  A resource such as iron, lumber, gold, or silver runs out.
51 - 57  A new land is discovered.
58 - 64  A new monster is discovered or appears.
65 - 71  A small number of people learn to cast spells and do magic.
72 - 78  Magic items are discovered.
79 - 85  A new intelligent species is discovered or appears.
86 - 92  The common people revolt against the ruling class.
93 - 99  A new religion begins or arrives.

############
#  2       # Decisions and Discussions
############

Whenever characters seek to influence the actions of other characters,
the Discussion subsystem can be used to give shape and direction to the
roleplay. It can apply to a wide variety of situations:

-   Councils
-   Making requests of a ruler
-   Trade negotiations
-   Talking out of a sticky situation
-   Influencing a mob
-   Self-reflection
-   Parleys
-   Alliance discussions
-   Leading an army

++++++++++++
+  2.01    + Description of a Discussion

The most simple form of a Discussion is when the people involved fall
into two groups: one group is trying to influence the other. The first
group can be called the "talkers" and the other the "listeners."
However, in most Discussions, both groups are looking to influence the
other group in some way, meaning they will fluidly switch roles back and
forth. Finally, in some Discussions there is only one participant who is
involved in self-reflection as they try to make a decision or come to a
conclusion. In this case, that person is both the talker and the
listener.

Regardless of the situation, the Discussion is made up of appeals. Each
appeal consists of the players role-playing the words and actions of
their characters as well as a few rolls of the dice. If the appeal is
successful, the listener will gain a new Driving Motivation.

During a discussion, role-play dictates who the talker is at any given
moment, and when they make appeals. If one group does not wish to have
an appeal made to them, they can try to escape (through the Contested
Movement subsystem), turn to violence (through the Hand-to-Hand
subsystem), or otherwise remove the talker from their presence. However,
if the two groups are in each other's presence, appeals cannot simply be
ignored. Once a listener has heard three appeals (successful or not),
they can choose to ignore further appeals until a new discussion begins.
A new discussion cannot begin if the situation (as relevant to the topic
of the appeals) hasn't changed. (This rule is in place to stop players
from re-hashing the same arguments over and over).

++++++++++++
+  2.02    + The Mechanics of Appeals

1.  Through role-play, the talker establishes the topic and the context.
    They also give the listener a suggested response or action. This
    role-play is meant to be fairly free form - say what each character
    would say, express their emotions (or lack of emotions), voice the
    concerns, questions, or counters of the listener, etc. It shouldn't
    feel too mechanical or constraining.
2.  The table decides the skill and motivation that will be used in the
    appeal rolls. Typically, the talker will state which skill and
    motivation they were expecting to use, and the rest of the table
    will agree. The skill will most often be one of Convince, Lead, or
    Administer depending on the tone and content of the appeal. (Other
    skills may be allowed if they are a better match). Which motivation
    largely depends on the action/response suggested to the listener.
3.  The table decides the appropriate difficulty of the skill check. If
    the listener does not have a Driving Motivation for the topic being
    considered, the difficulty should almost always be 2 or 3. If the
    listener does have a Driving Motivation for the context and topic,
    the difficulty is either 3 or the skill rating used for the appeal
    that gave them the Driving Motivation, whichever is higher.
4.  The talker rolls their skill check. If the skill check is
    successful, the listener rolls a 12-sided dice and compares to the
    strength of their motivation. If the result of the dice is equal or
    lower to the strength of the motivation, then that motivation
    becomes the Driving Motivation in the context of the topic
    established through role-play. The Driving Motivation (including the
    context, topic, and the motivation itself) should be written on the
    listener's character sheet to ensure that it is played out. The
    skill rating of the talker should also be written in case someone
    tries to change this Driving Motivation.

++++++++++++
+  2.03    + Character Motivations

The motivations of a character consist of 9 pairs:

           Energetic  vs  Lazy/Efficient
           Forgiving  vs  Avenging
              Honest  vs  Deceitful/Sly
       Merciful/Kind  vs  Cruel/Ruthless
       Modest/Humble  vs  Proud/Arrogant
    Prudent/Cautious  vs  Reckless
      Valourous/Bold  vs  Cowardly/Fearful
            Trusting  vs  Independent
Generous/Sacrificial  vs  Selfish/Hedonistic

Each of these 18 motivations has a rating from 2 to 10, and the two
motivations within one of the pairs cannot add to more than 12. For
example, if Morten Avitch is highly motivated by pride, his rating for
Proud would be 10. Morten cannot be both Proud and Humble, and to
reflect this his rating for Humble would be 2.

::::::::::::
:  2.03.01 : Driving Motivations

As described in 2.02, an appeal can cause one of a character's
motivations to become the Driving Motivation with respect to a specific
context and topic.

The player of a character who has been assigned a Driving Motivation has
quite a bit of freedom to decide how that motivation plays out. They do
not have to follow the exact suggestion of the talker. Additionally, in
situations that do not involve the specific context and topic of the 
Driving Motivation, the player is free to make decisions for the
character as the like. However, whenever that context and topic does
come up, the character's actions should most closely match the Driving
Motivation that has been assigned, and not any of the other motivations.

A character can have multiple Driving Motivations, as long as they each
have different contexts and topics. If a successful appeal is made
involving a context and topic that already has a Driving Motivation, the
old Driving Motivation is replaced. If the context and topic change to
the degree that the Driving Motivation is not relevant, then it can be
considered "played out" and is removed.

::::::::::::
:  2.03.02 : Character Growth

Characters who have been influenced to behave in certain ways can learn
from their experiences. If their actions as a result of a Driving
Motivation lead to negative consequences, they may choose to reduce the
rating of the motivation by a value of 1.

For example, after a Discussion with his sister Ella Avitch, Morten
gains the Driving Motivation of Pride/Arrogance with respect to a rival
noble claiming to be a better swordsmen. This leads to Morten
challenging the rival to a duel, which is played out through a Hand-to-
Hand scene. If Morten loses the duel, he may choose to lower his
Pride/Arrogance motivation from 10 to 9. (The motivation pair would now
be Modest/Humble 2, Proud/Arrogant 9 - it will no longer add to 12).

::::::::::::
:  2.03.03 : Motivation Ratings & Generation

When generating a character, the 9 motivational pairs should be
assigned the following pairs of ratings: 2 and 10 (one pair), 3 and 9
(two pairs), 4 and 8 (three pairs), 5 and 7 (two pairs), and 6 and 6
(one pair). The rating pairs are assigned randomly: first which assign
the rating pairs to the motivation pairs with an equal likelyhood, then
randomly (50% chance) switch the order of the rating pair.

For example, when generating motivation ratings for Morten Avitch, a
10-sided die is rolled to determine which motivation pair receives the
2 and 10 (if the result is 10, the die is rerolled). The result is a 5,
meaning the fifth motivation pair: Modest/Humble vs Proud/Arrogant. Then
an 8-sided die is rolled to determine which motivation pair receives one
of the 3 and 9s. The result is a 7, meaning the seventh unassigned
motivation pairs: Trusting vs Independent.

Once all the rating pairs have been assigned, a single die is rolled for
each. If the result is even, the order of the rating pair is switched.
The 2 and 10 was assigned to Modest/Humble vs Proud/Arrogant for Morten
Avitch. Morten's player rolls an 8-sided die and gets a 3, meaning the 2
is assigned to Modest/Humble and the 10 to Proud/Arrogant. One of the 3
and 9s was assigned to Trusting vs Independent. Morten's player rolls a
2, meaning the 3 is assigned to Independent and the 9 to Trusting.

++++++++++++
+  2.04    + Purpose of the Subsystem

This system, and the motivations that accompany it, are meant to provide
a role-playing guide to players. This should help players accurately
role-play multiple different personalities, especially when they are
playing multiple characters. The motivations can voluntarily be used by
players any time they are unsure of how the character would act, or they
want a reference for the personality of the character. The simplest way
to do this is to choose the motivation pair that best matches the
upcoming decision, and role-play the character in a way that matches the
higher rated of the two motivations.

The appeal mechanic is also meant to provide both mechanics and
inspiration to players looking to role-play social interactions. The
subsystem has been designed to avoid a number of pitfalls of mechanized
social interactions:
-   it doesn't reduce the interaction to a single roll that can occur
    without role-play,
-   it doesn't present an obvious "best move" to the talker, and so
    doesn't cause the talker to feel like the mechanics are dictating
    their actions,
-   it doesn't force the listener too tightly into taking actions they
    don't want to take (it isn't mind-control).

############
#  4       # Hand-to-Hand Combat
############

The Hand-to-Hand combat subsystem uses the Hand-to-Hand skills (Control,
Fighting Mind, Speed, and Strength) to calculate additional ratings. The
calculations of these ratings are described in their sections. Some of
the calculations involve a choice. Each combatant can make this choice
before beginning combat, but cannot change any of their choices during
combat.

++++++++++++
+  4.01    + Rounds

Each round consists of a Footwork contest, then the actions of the
combatants. The Footwork contest establishes the positioning of the
combatants. Then, both combatants choose (secretly) the action they
would like to take. Once both have chosen, both actions are resolved.
The consequences of the actions do not affect these rolls. At the end of
the round, new consequences are applied, old consequences are removed as
necessary, and if it is an even-numbered round, the Defensive Weakening
is increased.

++++++++++++
+  4.02    + Footwork, Movement, and Fight Distance

Hand-to-Hand combat takes place in a 1 meter grid (or 3 feet). Diagonals
count equally to non-diagonals. At any given moment, the fight has a
distance determined by the arrangement of the combatants. There are 3
distances: Dagger distance (adjacent), Sword distance (1 empty space
between combatants), and Spear distance (2 empty spaces between
combatants). The fight distance can be changed by the Footwork contest
or some actions.

Fight Distance, with C1 as Combatant 1 and C2 as Combatant 2:
  Dagger            Sword                  Spear
+----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+----+----+
| C1 | C2 |    | C1 |    | C2 |    | C1 |    |    | C2 |
+----+----+    +----+----+----+    +----+----+----+----+
     | C2 |         |    | C2 |         |    |    | C2 |
     +----+         +----+----+         +----+----+----+
                         | C2 |              |    | C2 |
                         +----+              +----+----+
                                                  | C2 |
                                                  +----+

A Footwork contest consists of a single skill check: one combatant's
Footwork rating against the other's. Footwork is equal to the
character's choice of Speed or Fighting Mind. The winner of the Footwork
contest may move 0 or 1 space.

The Fight Distance can give a -1 penalty to any action or to Parry
defenses that don't match the Fight Distance. For example, if the combat
is at Spear distance, an attack or parry with a sword will have a -1
penalty.

If a character cannot move, then they cannot take actions if the Fight
Distance is greater than the distance of their action. For example, a
character that is PRONE cannot attack an enemy at Spear distance with a
sword, nor can they Push the enemy.

::::::::::::
:  4.03.03 : Special Actions

Stand Up: this action allows a PRONE character to end that condition. If
chosen, it automatically succeeds.

Break Hold: this action allows a HELD character to end that condition.
The HELD character makes a skill check of their Hold rating against the
enemy's.

Break Tackle: this action allows a TACKLED character to end that
condition. The TACKLED character makes a skill check of their Tackle
rating against the enemy's.

++++++++++++
+  4.04    + Defenses

There are 4 defenses: Dodge, Parry, Strength, and Fighting Mind. Most
actions give a choice of defenses. When an enemy attempts an action, the
defender may choose which defense they would like to use.

Dodge:
-   Calculation: Speed
-   In the process of Dodging, the defender must move one space away. If
    there is no valid square to Dodge to, the defender cannot Dodge.
-   This movement is required whether the Dodge is succesful or not. In
    both cases, the attacker can choose to move one space towards the
    defender.

Parry:
-   Calculation: choice of Control - 2 or Fighting Mind - 2
-   In order to Parry, the defender must have either a weapon or a
    shield.
-   For the purposes of distance penalties, Parries have a distance
    determined by the weapon. When Parrying with a shield, no distance
    penalty can occur.
-   Unlike actions, it is possible to Parry at greater distances even if
    the defender cannot move. This is because the attack must come to
    the defender.

Strength: when Strength is used as a defense, the Strength rating is
used.

Fighting Mind: when Fighting Mind is used as a defense, the Fighting
Mind rating is used.

::::::::::::
:  4.04.01 : Defensive Weakening

Hand-to-Hand combat takes energy. As a fight progresses longer the
combatants lose their ability to defend. As part of the consequences of
the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. rounds, all defenses gain a -1 penalty (this
penalty accumulates, so that after the 4th round it is -2, after the 6th
round it is -3, etc).

The Defensive Weakening penalty applies to Strength and Fighting Mind
only when they are used as defenses.

++++++++++++
+  4.05    + Equipment

::::::::::::
:  4.05.01 : Weapons

Weapons can give small penalties or bonuses to certain actions or
defenses. If a two-handed weapon is used with only one hand, it has a -2
to all actions and defenses.

Dagger (Dagger Distance): -2 Parry
Rock (Dagger Distance): no Parry, -2 attacks
Hands (Dagger Distance): no Parry*, -4 attacks. (*unless the enemy is
    also unarmed)

Sword (Sword Distance)
Club (Sword Distance): -1 Parry
Hammer (Sword Distance): -1 Parry, +1 attacks
Axe (Sword Distance): -1 Parry, +1 attacks
Fencing Sword (Sword Distance): -1 attacks
Big Sword (Sword Distance): +1 attacks, two-handed

Spear (Spear Distance)
Staff (Spear Distance): -1 attacks
Halberd (Spear Distance): +1 attacks, two-handed

::::::::::::
:  4.05.02 : Armour and Shields

A shield gives a +1 bonus to Parry defenses and cannot suffer a distance
penalty.

Armour is assumed to apply to all parts of the body equally. There are
three types of armour:

Metal plate armour, which gives a +4 defense against attacks,
Other metal armour, which gives a +2 defense against attacks,
Other armour, which gives a +1 defense against attacks.

For example, a character with a shield and metal plate armour and a
Control rating of 3 will have a Parry rating of 3 - 2 + 1 = 2. When
defending an attack, this increases to a rating of 2 + 4 = 6.

++++++++++++
+  4.06    + Wounds

Wounds can apply to any of 6 body parts: the two arms, the two legs, the
body, and the head. Wounds have two severities: Minor Wounds and Major
Wounds. The effect of a wound depends on its location and severity. The
third Minor Wound on a given body part turns the first two Minor Wounds
into a Major Wound.

Arms: Minor Wounds have no immediate effect. Major Wounds cause the arm
(and whatever weapons or shields it is holding) to become useless.

Legs: Minor Wounds have no immediate effect. Major Wounds cause the leg
to become useless and the victim to be PRONE until the Major Wound is
healed. Outside of Hand-to-Hand combat, the victim can walk slowly for
short durations.

Head: Minor Wounds cause a -2 penalty to all Hand-to-Hand ratings until
healed. Major Wounds cause the victim to be incapable doing anything,
and the victim will die within the hour unless medical aid is given. An
enemy can kill the victim with an action (no skill check required).

Healing: The victim must make a roll each day for each wounded body
part. After 4 successes, all wounds to that body part are healed. For
Minor Wounds, roll a skill check as if the rating was 0 against 0. For
Major Wounds, roll a skill check as if the rating was 0 against 4.

++++++++++++
+  4.07    + Conditions

PRONE: Cannot take the Push action, use the Dodge defense, participate
in Footwork contests, or move. A Stand Up action will end this
condition.

HELD: Cannot participate in Footwork contests, or move. Additionally,
suffers a -2 penalty to Speed and Strength. A Break Hold action will end
this condition. For as long as a character is held, the Fight Distance
is Dagger distance. If the enemy releases the Hold, uses their hand for
another purpose, or is at a distance greater than Dagger distance, the
condition ends.

TACKLED: Cannot take the Push action, use the Dodge defense, participate
in Footwork contests, or move. Additionally, suffers a -2 penalty to
Control, Speed, and Strength. A Break Tackle action will end this
condition. For as long as the character is held, the Fight Distance is
Dagger distance. If the enemy releases the Tackle, uses their hand for
another purpose, or is at a distance greater than Dagger distance, the
TACKLED conditions ends, but the character is now PRONE.

++++++++++++
+  4.08    + Multi-Combatant Combat

If a Hand-to-Hand combat involves more than two combatants, it is broken
up into multiple Hand-to-Hand combats. Each individual combat must be
either 1 against 1, 1 against 2, 1 against 3, or 1 against 4. If one
side outnumbers the other to the degree that there could be combats more
lopsided than 1 against 4, there simply isn't enough room for all the
combatants. The side with more people must attack in waves.

If necessary the combatants are broken up before Hand-to-Hand combat
begins. This process begins with the side that has the greater number of
people. If the sides have the same number of people, it begins with the
side of the character with the highest rating in Fighting Mind. If the
sides are still equal, it begins with the side with the highest sum of
Fighting Mind ratings.

Alternating, each side will pick a combatant from their side and from
the enemy side to "pair up". When all the participants in one side are
"paired up," then any remaining combatants on the other side may choose
to join in with the other pairs. They may not fight 1 against 3 unless
all combats are 1 against 2 (a similar rule applies for fighting 1
against 4). This pairing process is a bit mechanical, but it simulates
how combatants fight against their nearest enemies.

Initial positioning is determined by the groupings and by the fiction.
If nothing else makes sense, simply line up with each combat at Spear
distance, and a gap of one space between each combat.

Each Hand-to-Hand combat plays out simultaneously. If an individual
combat ends due to surrender, Wounds, death, or fleeing, the victors may
choose to join another Hand-to-Hand combat. If joining would cause a 2
against many situation, then that Hand-to-Hand combat splits as deter-
mined by the positioning. Characters not in a Hand-to-Hand combat can
move 3 spaces after the Footwork contests.

Parrying: if a defender is fighting 1 against many, they can only Parry
two actions.

Dodging: if a defender is fighting 1 against many, they can Dodge any
number of actions as long as their single move qualifies as a Dodge for
those actions.

Footwork Contests: if a combatant is fighting 1 against many, they can
only move if they win a separate Footwork contest against each enemy.
Otherwise, each enemy that won their Footwork contest can move one
space.

Actions: if a combatant is fighting 1 against many, they must choose who
to direct their action against while choosing their action.
