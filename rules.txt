: 1.03.01 : Skill Rating Generation

When generating skill ratings randomly, the distribution of skill
ratings is as follows:

Rating  Number/million
 0       62500
 1      250000
 2      375000
 3      259860
 4       43773
 5        7374
 6        1242
 7         209
 8          35
 9           6
10           1

If this distribution is used to randomly generate main characters, the
rating should be shifted upwards by 2. For example, if the randomly
generated rating is 3, it should be shifted up to 5.

For each character, the skill ratings are generated in groups:

Hand-to-Hand:       Physical:       Knowledge:      Social:
Control             Endurance       Craft           Administer
Fighting Mind       Hide            Heal            Convince
Speed               Jump/Climb      Know            Lead
Strength            Ride            Notice          Perform
                    Run             Sail            Tactics
                    Shoot/Aim       Survive
                    Swim            Terrain ()
                                    Trade

1.  A rating (call it "r") is randomly generated for each group using
    the distribution above.
2.  That rating is multiplied by the number of skills in the group. This
    number is the "bank" that will be split to the skills in the group.
3.  Each skill is assigned a minimum of "r-3", if "r-3" is greater than
    0. For each value assigned to a rating, that same value is removed
    from the "bank".
4.  The remaining values in the "bank" are assigned to the skills
    randomly. If there are "n" skills in the group, then a dice (or
    other random generator) with "n" equal outcomes is used to determine
    which skill receives each value in the bank until the bank is empty.
    (No skill rating can exceed 10).

For example, the character Morten Avitch randomly generates the skill
rating for the "Hand-to-Hand" group to be 4. Then the bank is 16 (the
randomly generated value of 4 multiplied by 4 skills). Each of the
skills in the group are assigned a minimum of 1:

Control         1
Fighting Mind   1
Speed           1
Strength        1

The bank is now at 12. A d4 (because the group has 4 skills) is rolled
12 times, resulting in 1 (Control) being rolled 3 times, 2 (Fighting
Mind) being rolled 2 times, 3 (Speed) being rolled 2 times, and 4
(Strength) being rolled 5 times. This results in the following skill
rankings:

Control         1 + 3 = 4
Fighting Mind   1 + 2 = 3
Speed           1 + 2 = 3
Strength        1 + 5 = 6
