:  1.01    : Introduction

::::::::::::
:  1.02    : General Mechanics

Many situations can be resolved with one of the 4 subsystems. Within
those subsystems, skill checks are used to resolve opposed actions. For
any other situations where two characters are opposing each other, or an
unopposed character is taking an action with a risk of failure or
consequences, the same skill checks are used. Whenever this more free-
form roleplaying occurs, it should be adjudicated by the table as a
whole. If there are any players whose characters are not involved, they
are considered third-party and can take on extra adjudication
responsibilities.

............
:  1.02.01 : Skill Checks

Skill checks are primarily used when two characters are taking actions
that are in opposition to each other. This can include one character
trying to take an action while the other tries to prevent them from
succeed, or both characters trying to take independent actions where it
is important to know which action is quicker or more effective. For this
reason, the vast majority of skill checks use a skill rating from each
of the two characters involved.

When there is only one character taking action, but that action has a
risk of failing or causing other undesired consequences, the skill check
uses a skill rating from the character and substitutes a difficulty
rating for the missing character. The difficulty rating is determined by
third-party players at the table. A good default value is 3. The
consequence of failure should be known to the player before attempting
the unopposed skill check. If they do not want to take the risk
associated with the skill check, they can role-play to change the
situation, which changes the difficulty and consequences.

In the resolution of a skill check, the difference between the skill
ratings (or the skill rating and the difficulty) is used to determine
how many dice to roll. If "d" is the difference (must be positive), then
"d+2" 8-sided dice are rolled. If any single dice shows a 7 or an 8,
then the character with the higher skill rating was successful (or
performed better). If "d" is 0, then a single dice is rolled, with the
characters having an equal chance of success.

............
:  1.02.02 : Skill Check Examples

If Morten Avitch is racing against his sister Ella Avitch, then they
might roll their "Run" skills against each other. If Morten's "Run" is 2
and Ella's is 4, then four 8-sided dice are rolled. If any of the dice
show 7 or 8, then Ella is faster. Ella's player rolls the dice, and gets
2, 2, 3, 6, so Morten wins the race.

If Morten Avitch is trying to climb a cliff. He has a "Jump/Climb"
rating of 3, and the cliff has a difficulty of 3 (where the consequence
is falling up to 15 feet, causing a major wound). He doesn't want to
take this risk, so he decides to throw a rope around a tree. (Throwing
the rope doesn't require a roll unless there is a potential consequence,
like a time-pressure or the potential to lost the rope). With the rope
tied, the skill check now has a difficulty of 2, but the consequence is
that Morten is simply too weak to be able to make the climb. Morten can
now roll 3 8-sided dice, where a 7 or 8 indicates a successful climb (as
Morten's "Jump/Climb" is higher than the cliff's difficulty of 2). He
rolls a 4, 6, 8, and makes the climb.

............
:  1.02.03 : Note About Dice

In order to play this game, it is recommended that the table as a whole
has at least 10 8-sided dice to share, and one 20-sided die.
Additionally, each player should have a single 12-sided dice.

Technically, the 8-sided dice can be substituted for other dice. The key
property is that they must be a multiple of 4-sided: 4-sided, 8-sided,
12-sided, or 20-sided. For 4-sided dice, success occurs on a 4. For
8-sided dice, success occurs on a 7 or 8. For 12-sided dice, success
occurs on a 10, 11, or 12. Finally, for 20-sided dice, success occurs on
a 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.

The ratings go from 0 to 10, with an average of 2. Most people fall
between 0 and 4.

...........
: 1.03.01 : Skill Rating Generation

When generating skill ratings randomly, the distribution of skill
ratings is as follows:

Rating  Number/million
 0       62500
 1      250000
 2      375000
 3      250000
 4       52000
 5        8700
 6        1500
 7         250
 8          40
 9           8
10           2

If this distribution is used to randomly generate main characters, the
rating should be shifted upwards by 2. For example, if the randomly
generated rating is 3, it should be shifted up to 5.

For each character, the skill ratings are generated in groups:

Hand-to-Hand:       Physical:       Knowledge:      Social:
Control             Endurance       Craft           Administer
Fighting Mind       Hide            Heal            Convince
Speed               Jump/Climb      Know            Lead
Strength            Ride            Notice          Perform
                    Run             Sail            Tactics
                    Shoot/Aim       Survive
                    Swim            Trade

1.  A rating (call it "r") is randomly generated for each group using
    the distribution above.
2.  That rating is multiplied by the number of skills in the group. This
    number is the "bank" that will be split to the skills in the group.
3.  Each skill is assigned a minimum of "r-3", if "r-3" is greater than
    0. For each value assigned to a rating, that same value is removed
    from the "bank".
4.  The remaining values in the "bank" are assigned to the skills
    randomly. If there are "n" skills in the group, then a dice (or
    other random generator) with "n" equal outcomes is used to determine
    which skill receives each value in the bank until the bank is empty.
    (No skill rating can exceed 10).

For example, the character Morten Avitch randomly generates the skill
rating for the "Hand-to-Hand" group to be 4. Then the bank is 16 (the
randomly generated value of 4 multiplied by 4 skills). Each of the
skills in the group are assigned a minimum of 1:

Control         1
Fighting Mind   1
Speed           1
Strength        1

The bank is now at 12. A d4 (because the group has 4 skills) is rolled
12 times, resulting in 1 (Control) being rolled 3 times, 2 (Fighting
Mind) being rolled 2 times, 3 (Speed) being rolled 2 times, and 4
(Strength) being rolled 5 times. This results in the following skill
rankings:

Control         1 + 3 = 4
Fighting Mind   1 + 2 = 3
Speed           1 + 2 = 3
Strength        1 + 5 = 6
