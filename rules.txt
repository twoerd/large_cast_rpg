Many situations can be resolved with one of the 4 subsystems. Within
those subsystems, skill checks are used to resolve opposed actions. For
any other situations where two characters are opposing each other, or an
unopposed character is taking an action with a risk of failure or
consequences, the same skill checks are used. Whenever this more free-
form roleplaying occurs, it should be adjudicated by the table as a
whole. If there are any players whose characters are not involved, they
are considered third-party and can take on extra adjudication
responsibilities.

::::::::::::
:  1.02.01 : Skill Checks

Skill checks are primarily used when two characters are taking actions
that are in opposition to each other. This can include one character
trying to take an action while the other tries to prevent them from
succeed, or both characters trying to take independent actions where it
is important to know which action is quicker or more effective. For this
reason, the vast majority of skill checks use a skill rating from each
of the two characters involved.

When there is only one character taking action, but that action has a
risk of failing or causing other undesired consequences, the skill check
uses a skill rating from the character and substitutes a difficulty
rating for the missing character. The difficulty rating is determined by
third-party players at the table. A good default value is 3. The
consequence of failure should be known to the player before attempting
the unopposed skill check. If they do not want to take the risk
associated with the skill check, they can role-play to change the
situation, which changes the difficulty and consequences.

In the resolution of a skill check, the difference between the skill
ratings (or the skill rating and the difficulty) is used to determine
how many dice to roll. If "d" is the difference (must be positive), then
"d+2" 8-sided dice are rolled. If any single dice shows a 7 or an 8,
then the character with the higher skill rating was successful (or
performed better). If "d" is 0, then a single dice is rolled, with the
characters having an equal chance of success.

::::::::::::
:  1.02.02 : Skill Check Examples

If Morten Avitch is racing against his sister Ella Avitch, then they
might roll their "Run" skills against each other. If Morten's "Run" is 2
and Ella's is 4, then four 8-sided dice are rolled. If any of the dice
show 7 or 8, then Ella is faster. Ella's player rolls the dice, and gets
2, 2, 3, 6, so Morten wins the race.

If Morten Avitch is trying to climb a cliff. He has a "Jump/Climb"
rating of 3, and the cliff has a difficulty of 3 (where the consequence
is falling up to 15 feet, causing a major wound). He doesn't want to
take this risk, so he decides to throw a rope around a tree. (Throwing
the rope doesn't require a roll unless there is a potential consequence,
like a time-pressure or the potential to lost the rope). With the rope
tied, the skill check now has a difficulty of 2, but the consequence is
that Morten is simply too weak to be able to make the climb. Morten can
now roll 3 8-sided dice, where a 7 or 8 indicates a successful climb (as
Morten's "Jump/Climb" is higher than the cliff's difficulty of 2). He
rolls a 4, 6, 8, and makes the climb.

::::::::::::
:  1.02.03 : Note About Dice

In order to play this game, the table as a whole will need at least one
set of commonly-available polyhedral dice. The set consists of a 4-sided
dice, a 6-sided dice, an 8-sided dice, a 10-sided dice (numbered from 0
to 9), a 10-sided dice (numbered from 00 to 90), a 12-sided dice, and a
20-sided dice. It is recommended that the table as a whole has at least
ten 8-sided dice to share.

Technically, the 8-sided dice can be substituted for other dice. The key
property is that they must be a multiple of 4-sided: 4-sided, 8-sided,
12-sided, or 20-sided. For 4-sided dice, success occurs on a 4. For
8-sided dice, success occurs on a 7 or 8. For 12-sided dice, success
occurs on a 10, 11, or 12. Finally, for 20-sided dice, success occurs on
a 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.

The ratings go from 0 to 10, with an average of 2. Most people fall
between 0 and 4.

:::::::::::
: 1.03.01 : Skill Rating Generation

When generating skill ratings randomly, the distribution of skill
ratings is as follows:

Rating  Number/million
 0       62500
 1      250000
 2      375000
 3      250000
 4       52000
 5        8700
 6        1500
 7         250
 8          40
 9           8
10           2

If this distribution is used to randomly generate main characters, the
rating should be shifted upwards by 2. For example, if the randomly
generated rating is 3, it should be shifted up to 5.

For each character, the skill ratings are generated in groups:

Hand-to-Hand:       Physical:       Knowledge:      Social:
Control             Endurance       Craft           Administer
Fighting Mind       Hide            Heal            Convince
Speed               Jump/Climb      Know            Lead
Strength            Ride            Notice          Perform
                    Run             Sail            Tactics
                    Shoot/Aim       Survive
                    Swim            Trade

1.  A rating (call it "r") is randomly generated for each group using
    the distribution above.
2.  That rating is multiplied by the number of skills in the group. This
    number is the "bank" that will be split to the skills in the group.
3.  Each skill is assigned a minimum of "r-3", if "r-3" is greater than
    0. For each value assigned to a rating, that same value is removed
    from the "bank".
4.  The remaining values in the "bank" are assigned to the skills
    randomly. If there are "n" skills in the group, then a dice (or
    other random generator) with "n" equal outcomes is used to determine
    which skill receives each value in the bank until the bank is empty.
    (No skill rating can exceed 10).

For example, the character Morten Avitch randomly generates the skill
rating for the "Hand-to-Hand" group to be 4. Then the bank is 16 (the
randomly generated value of 4 multiplied by 4 skills). Each of the
skills in the group are assigned a minimum of 1:

Control         1
Fighting Mind   1
Speed           1
Strength        1

The bank is now at 12. A d4 (because the group has 4 skills) is rolled
12 times, resulting in 1 (Control) being rolled 3 times, 2 (Fighting
Mind) being rolled 2 times, 3 (Speed) being rolled 2 times, and 4
(Strength) being rolled 5 times. This results in the following skill
rankings:

Control         1 + 3 = 4
Fighting Mind   1 + 2 = 3
Speed           1 + 2 = 3
Strength        1 + 5 = 6

#  2       # Decisions and Discussions
############

++++++++++++
+  2.01    + Description of a Discussion

During a discussion, there are typically two groups of people. Most
commonly, one group takes on the role of the talker and the other takes
on the role of the listener. These roles switch back and forth as each
side raise their points and tries to influence the other group. In some
cases, however, the talker stays the talker then entire time. In other
cases the talker and the listener are the same person, which allows this
subsystem to be used to explore a single characters Motivations and
momentous decisions.

A discussion is made up of Appeals. Each Appeal consists of the players
role-playing the words and actions of their characters as well as a few
rolls of the dice to resolve how the motivations of the listener may
have changed.

During a discussion, role-play dictates who the talker is at any given
moment, and when they make Appeals. If one group does not wish to have
an Appeal made to them, they can try to escape (through the Contested
Movement subsystem), turn to violence (through the Hand-to-Hand
subsystem), or otherwise remove the talker from their presence. However,
if the two groups are in each other's presence, Appeals cannot simply be
ignored. Once a listener has heard three Appeals (successful or not),
they can choose to ignore further Appeals until a new discussion begins.
A new discussion cannot begin if the situation (as relevant to the topic
of the Appeals) hasn't changed. (This rule is in place to stop players
from re-hashing the same arguments over and over).

++++++++++++
+  2.02    + The Mechanics of Appeals

1.  Through role-play, the talker establishes the topic and the context.
    They also give the listener a suggested response or action. This
    role-play is meant to be fairly free form - say what each character
    would say, express their emotions (or lack of emotions), voice the
    concerns, questions, or counters of the listener, etc. It shouldn't
    feel too mechanical or constraining.
2.  The table decides the skill and motivation that will be used in the
    Appeal rolls. Typically, the talker will state which skill and
    motivation they were expecting to use, and the rest of the table
    will agree. The skill will most often be one of Convince, Lead, or
    Administer depending on the tone and content of the Appeal. (Other
    skills may be allowed if they are a better match). Which motivation
    largely depends on the action/response suggested to the listener.
3.  The table decides the appropriate difficulty of the skill check.
    This should almost always be 2 or 3. If the listener already has a
    Driving Motivation for the context and topic, the difficulty is 3.
4.  The talker rolls their skill check. If the skill check is
    successful, the listener rolls a 12-sided dice and compares to the
    strength of their motivation. If the result of the dice is equal or
    lower to the strength of the motivation, then that motivation
    becomes the Driving Motivation in the context of the topic
    established through role-play. The context, topic, and Driving
    Motivation should be written on the listener's character sheet.

++++++++++++
+  2.03    + Character Motivations

The motivations of a character consist of 9 pairs:

           Energetic  vs  Lazy/Efficient
           Forgiving  vs  Avenging
              Honest  vs  Deceitful/Sly
       Merciful/Kind  vs  Cruel/Ruthless
       Modest/Humble  vs  Proud/Arrogant
    Prudent/Cautious  vs  Reckless
      Valourous/Bold  vs  Cowardly/Fearful
            Trusting  vs  Independent
Generous/Sacrificial  vs  Selfish/Hedonistic

Each of these 18 motivations has a rating from 2 to 10, and the two
motivations within one of the pairs cannot add to more than 12. For
example, if Morten Avitch is highly motivated by pride, his rating for
Proud would be 10. Morten cannot be both Proud and Humble, and to
reflect this his rating for Humble would be 2.

::::::::::::
:  2.03.01 : Driving Motivations

As described in 2.02, an Appeal can cause one of a character's
motivations to become the Driving Motivation with respect to a specific
context and topic.

The player of a character who has been assigned a Driving Motivation has
quite a bit of freedom to decide how that motivation plays out. They do
not have to follow the exact suggestion of the talker. Additionally, in
situations that do not involve the specific context and topic of the 
Driving Motivation, the player is free to make decisions for the
character as the like. However, whenever that context and topic does
come up, the character's actions should most closely match the Driving
Motivation that has been assigned, and not any of the other Motivations.

A character can have multiple Driving Motivations, as long as they each
have different contexts and topics. If a successful Appeal is made
involving a context and topic that already has a Driving Motivation, the
old Driving Motivation is replaced.

::::::::::::
:  2.03.02 : Values of Motivations

When generating a character, the 9 Motivational pairs should be
assigned the following pairs of ratings: 2 and 10 (one pair), 3 and 9
(two pairs), 4 and 8 (three pairs), 5 and 7 (two pairs), and 6 and 6
(one pair). The rating pairs are assigned randomly: first which assign
the rating pairs to the Motivation pairs with an equal likelyhood, then
randomly (50% chance) switch the order of the rating pair.

For example, when generating Motivation ratings for Morten Avitch, a
10-sided die is rolled to determine which Motivation pair receives the
2 and 10 (if the result is 10, the die is rerolled). The result is a 5,
meaning the fifth Motivation pair: Modest/Humble vs Proud/Arrogant. Then
an 8-sided die is rolled to determine which Motivation pair receives one
of the 3 and 9s. The result is a 7, meaning the seventh unassigned
Motivation pairs: Trusting vs Independent.

Once all the rating pairs have been assigned, a single die is rolled for
each. If the result is even, the order of the rating pair is switched.
The 2 and 10 was assigned to Modest/Humble vs Proud/Arrogant for Morten
Avitch. Morten's player rolls an 8-sided die and gets a 3, meaning the 2
is assigned to Modest/Humble and the 10 to Proud/Arrogant. One of the 3
and 9s was assigned to Trusting vs Independent. Morten's player rolls a
2, meaning the 3 is assigned to Independent and the 9 to Trusting.

++++++++++++
+  2.04    + Purpose of the Subsystem

This system, and the motivations that accompany it, are meant to provide
a role-playing guide to players. This should help players accurately
role-play multiple different personalities, especially when they are
playing multiple characters. The motivations can voluntarily be used by
players any time they are unsure of how the character would act, or they
want a reference for the personality of the character. The simplest way
to do this is to choose the Motivation pair that best matches the
upcoming decision, and role-play the character in a way that matches the
higher rated of the two Motivations.

The Appeal mechanic is also meant to provide both mechanics and
inspiration to players looking to role-play social interactions. The
subsystem has been designed to avoid a number of pitfalls of mechanized
social interactions:
-   it doesn't reduce the interaction to a single roll that can occur
    without role-play,
-   it doesn't present an obvious best argument to the talker leaving
    the talker feeling like the mechanics are dictating their actions,
-   it doesn't force the listener too tightly into taking actions they
    don't want to take.
